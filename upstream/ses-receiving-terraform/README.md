# SES Receiving Terraform

This Terraform configuration stands up an AWS SES inbound email pipeline: incoming messages for a subdomain are accepted by SES, written to an encrypted S3 bucket, optionally fanned out via SNS/SQS, and finally organized per-recipient by a Lambda function.

## What It Provisions

- Secure, versioned S3 bucket used as the landing zone for raw `.eml` files.
- SNS topic and SQS queue pair for event fan-out and downstream processing, including a DLQ.
- IAM roles and policies that grant SES write access and let the Lambda manipulate objects in the bucket.
- Lambda function (`lambda/handler.py`) that moves each message into a folder named after the recipient.
- SES receipt rule set and rule that trigger the S3 store action and Lambda invocation.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform `>= 1.6.0`
- AWS provider `>= 5.50`
- An SES-supported AWS region with inbound email receiving enabled.
- Access to manage DNS for the target domain (e.g., Route53 hosted zone, third-party DNS provider).

## Usage

1. Ensure your AWS credentials are configured (e.g., via `aws configure` or environment variables).
2. Copy `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars` and fill in your values:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   ```
   Then edit `terraform.tfvars` with your specific configuration. The file is git-ignored and will not be committed.
3. Initialize and deploy:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Configure DNS records** - After the initial deployment, retrieve the required DNS records:
   ```bash
   terraform output dns_records_summary
   ```

   This will display all DNS records you need to create in your DNS provider. You must add:
   - **1 MX record** - Directs incoming email to AWS SES
   - **1 TXT record** - Verifies domain ownership with SES
   - **3 CNAME records** - Enables DKIM email authentication

5. **Add the DNS records** to your DNS provider (Route53, Cloudflare, etc.):
   - If using Route53, you can add these records via the AWS console or CLI
   - If using a third-party DNS provider, add them through their interface
   - DNS propagation typically takes 5-15 minutes but can take up to 48 hours

6. **Verify domain identity** - Check that SES has verified your domain:
   ```bash
   aws ses get-identity-verification-attributes --identities $(terraform output -raw subdomain_fqdn)
   ```

   Wait until the verification status shows `"Success"`. This usually takes a few minutes after DNS propagation.

7. **Verify the SES receipt rule set is active** (automatically activated by Terraform):
   ```bash
   aws ses describe-active-receipt-rule-set
   ```

   The active rule set name should match:
   ```bash
   terraform output -raw ses_receipt_rule_set_name
   ```

   If you need to manually activate it (e.g., after deactivation):
   ```bash
   aws ses set-active-receipt-rule-set --rule-set-name $(terraform output -raw ses_receipt_rule_set_name)
   ```

## Testing the Pipeline

After deployment and DNS propagation, verify the email pipeline is working:

1. **Set environment variables from Terraform outputs**:
   ```bash
   export SUBDOMAIN=$(terraform output -raw subdomain_fqdn)
   export BUCKET=$(terraform output -raw s3_bucket_name)
   export LAMBDA_NAME=$(terraform output -raw lambda_function_name)
   ```

2. **Send a test email** to `test@<your-subdomain>`:
   ```bash
   # Using the mail command (macOS/Linux)
   echo "This is a test message" | mail -s "Test Subject" test@$SUBDOMAIN

   # Or use any email client to send to test@$SUBDOMAIN
   ```

3. **List the S3 bucket contents** to verify the email was received:
   ```bash
   # View all objects in the bucket
   aws s3 ls s3://$BUCKET/ --recursive

   # Expected output shows files organized by recipient:
   # 2026-01-01 12:34:56    1234 test@yourdomain.com/abc123def456.eml
   ```

4. **Download and view a specific email file**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the email file to your local machine (replace MESSAGE_ID with actual value from step 3)
   aws s3 cp s3://$BUCKET/test@$SUBDOMAIN/MESSAGE_ID.eml ./test-email.eml

   # View the raw email content
   cat ./test-email.eml
   ```

5. **Check Lambda execution logs** (optional):
   ```bash
   # View recent Lambda logs to verify processing
   aws logs tail /aws/lambda/$LAMBDA_NAME --follow
   ```

**Note:** SES may take a few minutes to process incoming emails. If you don't see files immediately, wait 2-3 minutes and check again. Also ensure your AWS account is out of SES sandbox mode, or that the sender email is verified.

### Example `terraform.tfvars`

```hcl
region         = "us-east-2"
subdomain_fqdn = "app.markcallen.dev"
bucket_name    = "ses-inbound-app-markcallen-dev"
project_tag    = "ses-receive-app-markcallen-dev"
project        = "ses-inbound"
environment    = "dev"

# Optional: Grant IAM users/groups access to read emails from S3
# s3_access_iam_users = ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/test-user"]
# s3_access_iam_groups = ["developers"]
```

## Lambda Behavior

The Lambda at `lambda/handler.py` copies each raw message from the `incoming/` prefix into a folder named after each recipient (`recipient@example.com/messageId.eml`) and deletes the original object. This keeps the bucket tidy while preserving message data per mailbox.

## Architecture

This section provides a detailed view of the AWS SES inbound email pipeline architecture and data flow.

### Data Flow

1. **Email Arrival**
   - External email sent to `<user>@<subdomain_fqdn>`
   - DNS MX record routes to AWS SES (`inbound-smtp.<region>.amazonaws.com`)
   - SES receives email and verifies domain ownership via TXT record

2. **SES Receipt Rule Processing** (Rule: `${project_tag}-rule`)
   - **Position 1 - S3 Action**: Stores raw email as `.eml` file in `s3://<bucket>/incoming/<messageId>`
   - SES publishes notification to SNS topic
   - **Position 2 - Lambda Action**: Invokes Lambda function with SES event payload

3. **Lambda Processing** (`move_to_recipient_folder`)
   - Receives SES event with message metadata (recipients, message ID)
   - For each recipient in the email:
     - Copies email from `incoming/<messageId>.eml` to `<recipient>/<messageId>.eml`
   - Deletes original email from `incoming/` folder
   - Logs execution to CloudWatch Logs (retained for 14 days)

4. **Event Fan-out** (Optional downstream processing)
   - S3 ObjectCreated event triggers SNS notification
   - SNS publishes to SQS queue for downstream consumers
   - Failed processing attempts (5 retries) move message to Dead Letter Queue

5. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Lambda execution logs in CloudWatch Logs
   - CloudWatch metrics for Lambda invocations, errors, duration
   - SQS queue depth and DLQ messages indicate processing issues

### Key Components

| Component | Resource Name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **S3 Bucket** | `${bucket_name}` | Secure storage for email files (encrypted at rest with AES256) |
| **SES Domain** | `${subdomain_fqdn}` | Verified domain identity for receiving email |
| **SES Rule Set** | `${project_tag}-rule-set` | Active receipt rule set containing processing rules |
| **SES Receipt Rule** | `${project_tag}-rule` | Defines S3 storage and Lambda invocation actions |
| **Lambda Function** | `${project_tag}-move` | Organizes emails into recipient-specific folders |
| **CloudWatch Logs** | `/aws/lambda/${project_tag}-move` | Lambda execution logs with configurable retention |
| **SNS Topic** | `${project_tag}-topic` | Publishes S3 events for downstream processing |
| **SQS Queue** | `${project_tag}-queue` | Main queue for event consumers |
| **SQS DLQ** | `${project_tag}-dlq` | Dead letter queue for failed processing |

### Security Features

- **S3 Encryption**: Server-side encryption (AES256) for all stored emails
- **S3 Versioning**: Enabled to protect against accidental deletions
- **Public Access Blocking**: All public access to S3 bucket is blocked
- **IAM Least Privilege**: Separate roles for SES and Lambda with minimal required permissions
- **TLS Support**: Optional TLS for email transport (configurable to "Require")
- **Virus Scanning**: SES automatic virus scanning enabled (`scan_enabled: true`)

### Cost Considerations

- **SES Receiving**: First 1,000 emails/month free, then $0.10 per 1,000 emails
- **S3 Storage**: ~$0.023/GB/month (Standard storage class)
- **Lambda Invocations**: First 1M requests/month free, then $0.20 per 1M
- **Lambda Duration**: First 400,000 GB-seconds/month free
- **CloudWatch Logs**: $0.50/GB ingested, $0.03/GB stored (14-day retention limits costs)
- **SNS/SQS**: Minimal costs for low-to-moderate email volume

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) >= 1.6.0
- [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) for Terraform linting
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for automated code quality checks
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Python 3.12 (for Lambda development)

### Setting Up Pre-Commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to automatically check code quality before commits. The hooks run:
- General file checks (JSON, YAML validation, trailing whitespace, large files, private keys)
- Terraform formatting (`terraform fmt`)
- Terraform validation (`terraform validate`)
- TFLint checks (`terraform_tflint`)

1. **Install pre-commit** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install pre-commit

   # Linux/WSL
   pip install pre-commit

   # Windows
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. **Install the git hooks** in your local repository:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Run hooks manually** on all files (optional, but recommended for first-time setup):
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

Once installed, the hooks will automatically run on `git commit`. If any hook fails, the commit will be blocked until you fix the issues.

**Manual execution:**
```bash
# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run on staged files only
pre-commit run

# Run a specific hook
pre-commit run terraform_fmt
```

### Setting Up TFLint

TFLint helps catch errors and enforce best practices in your Terraform code.

1. **Install TFLint** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install tflint

   # Linux
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-linters/tflint/master/install_linux.sh | bash

   # Windows
   choco install tflint
   ```

2. **Initialize TFLint** (downloads required plugins):
   ```bash
   tflint --init
   ```

**Note:** TFLint is automatically run by pre-commit hooks if you've set them up (see above).

### Development Workflow

When modifying Terraform configuration files:

1. **Make your changes** to `.tf` files
2. **Format the code**:
   ```bash
   terraform fmt
   ```
3. **Run TFLint** to check for errors and best practices:
   ```bash
   tflint
   ```
4. **Validate the configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```
5. **Review the execution plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
6. **Apply changes** (if plan looks correct):
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

**Important:** Always run `tflint` after modifying any `.tf` file before committing or applying changes.

### Modifying the Lambda Function

1. Edit `lambda/handler.py`
2. Test your changes locally if possible
3. Run `terraform apply` to deploy (automatically packages and uploads the Lambda)
4. Monitor logs for errors:
   ```bash
   aws logs tail /aws/lambda/$(terraform output -raw lambda_function_name) --follow
   ```

## Reading Emails from S3

For E2E testing or programmatic email access, use the separate [`ses-email-client`](https://github.com/everydaydevops/ses-email-client) npm package.

### Quick Start

1. **Get the role ARN and bucket name from Terraform outputs:**
   ```bash
   terraform output -raw s3_access_role_arn
   terraform output -raw s3_bucket_name
   ```

2. **Install the email client in your project:**
   ```bash
   npm install @ses-receiving/email-client
   ```

3. **Use in your E2E tests:**
   ```typescript
   import { SESEmailClient } from '@ses-receiving/email-client';

   const client = new SESEmailClient({
     bucketName: process.env.SES_BUCKET_NAME!,
     roleArn: process.env.SES_S3_ACCESS_ROLE_ARN,
     region: 'us-east-1'
   });

   const email = await client.waitForLatestEmail('test@your-subdomain.com', 30000);
   ```

## Cleanup

To tear down all provisioned resources, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Remember to empty the S3 bucket or enable `force_destroy` if you modify the configuration.
