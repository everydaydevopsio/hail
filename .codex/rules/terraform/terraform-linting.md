# Terraform Linting Rules

## Your Responsibilities

1. Pin the Terraform CLI version with `tfenv` and commit `.terraform-version` so local, CI, and review workflows use the same version. If the repo already standardizes on `asdf` or `mise`, keep that manager consistent instead of adding a second version manager.
2. Add `terraform fmt -check -recursive` as the baseline formatting gate and keep HCL style consistent.
3. Run `terraform init -backend=false` before `terraform validate` so validation can install providers without touching remote state.
4. Add `tflint` with `.tflint.hcl` plugin blocks for the active cloud providers or module rules, then run `tflint --init` before recursive linting.
5. Prefer `trivy config` for new security-scanning work. Keep `tfsec` only when an existing repo or CI pipeline still depends on it, because tfsec is now part of Trivy.
6. Keep Terraform code modular, typed, and explicit: variables with types, outputs with descriptions where useful, and provider/version constraints in `versions.tf`.
7. Prefer remote state, locked provider versions, least-privilege IAM, and secret-free code checked into Git.
8. Coordinate with the `git-hooks` rules when the repo should enforce local hook checks.

## Baseline Tooling

- `tfenv`
- `terraform fmt`
- `terraform validate`
- `tflint`
- `trivy config`
- `tfsec` for legacy-compatible pipelines

## Implementation Order

1. Detect the repo shape and keep it readable with root files such as `versions.tf`, `providers.tf`, `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` where that split helps review. Do not force the split when an existing module layout is already clear.
2. Add or update `.terraform-version` and document `tfenv install` plus `tfenv use`.
3. Add or update `.tflint.hcl` with provider-specific plugin blocks, for example `plugin "aws"`, `plugin "azurerm"`, or `plugin "google"` with pinned versions and sources.
4. Add CI lint and security commands with workflow `concurrency` so redundant validation runs for the same ref are cancelled.
5. Run format, backend-free init, validate, lint, and security checks.

## Example Layout

Use repositories shaped like a straightforward Terraform service or environment:

- `.terraform-version`
- `versions.tf`
- `providers.tf`
- `main.tf`
- `variables.tf`
- `outputs.tf`
- `modules/<name>/main.tf`
- `envs/<name>/terraform.tfvars`

That layout keeps the project easy to review:

- version constraints are visible at the root
- providers and backend settings are separated from resources
- modules are reusable and independently testable
- environment-specific values stay out of the shared module code

## Commands

- `tfenv install`
- `tfenv use`
- `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
- `terraform init -backend=false`
- `terraform validate`
- `tflint --init`
- `tflint --recursive`
- `trivy config .`
- `tfsec .` when preserving a legacy pipeline

For OpenTofu repositories, use the equivalent commands and keep the repo standardized on one CLI:

- `tofu fmt -check -recursive`
- `tofu init -backend=false`
- `tofu validate`
- `tofu test` when native tests exist

## Important Notes

- Commit `.terraform-version` and keep it aligned with `required_version` in `versions.tf`.
- Run `terraform fmt` before asking CI to validate formatting drift.
- Run `tflint --init` after changing `.tflint.hcl` plugin blocks or plugin versions.
- Keep provider constraints explicit and avoid unbounded major-version upgrades.
- Use typed variables and validation blocks for inputs that have strict formats.
- Prefer modules over copy-pasted resources when a pattern repeats.
- Do not commit secrets, state files, plan files, or generated `.terraform/` directories.
- Prefer remote state with locking for shared environments.
- Use data sources and outputs deliberately; avoid exposing sensitive values unless necessary and mark them `sensitive = true`.

## When Completed

1. Show the user the Terraform lint, format, and security files you added or updated.
2. Explain the default local validation command set.
3. Point out any state, secret-handling, provider-version, or module-structure issues that still need manual review.
