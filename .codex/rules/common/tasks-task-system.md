# Task System Integration

Use the configured task system for durable work items. Check and configure the task system MCP server when asked and when a non-`none` task system is configured.

---
## Activation

External issue tracking is active (`taskSystem: github`). This repository uses **GitHub** as the system of record for all planned work, follow-up tasks, bugs, and feature requests. All durable work items must be created there, not left only in local notes or branch files.

## MCP Server Setup

When the user asks to set up, check, or configure their task system MCP: check whether the MCP server for **GitHub** is already configured for this platform (see below); confirm success if it connects, otherwise walk the user through the setup steps. If the repository changes its saved `taskSystem` value, re-run `ballast install --refresh-config` so this rule matches the configured system.

### MCP Server

**GitHub Issues** (`github`):
- MCP server: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
- Requires a GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope.
- The token should be set as `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the platform config.

### Platform Setup Steps

**Codex:**
- MCP servers are configured per the OpenAI Codex CLI docs; check `~/.codex/config.json` or the equivalent config file.
- Add the server entry and restart the CLI session.

## Using GitHub for Work Items

- Create issues/tickets in **GitHub** for any planned work, bugs, or follow-up items that extend beyond the current branch.
- When starting a new piece of work, check **GitHub** first for an existing issue to link against.
- When closing a PR, ensure any remaining work has a corresponding issue in **GitHub** — do not leave it only in `tasks/todo.md`.
- Reference issue IDs in commit messages and PR descriptions so work is traceable.

## Important Notes

- `tasks/todo.md` is a branch-local task artifact, not a substitute for durable issue tracking (see the `tasks/todo.md` rule).
- If the MCP server is unavailable, fall back to the **GitHub** web UI and link issues manually in PR descriptions.
- Keep credentials out of committed files; use environment variables or platform secret stores.
