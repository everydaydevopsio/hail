# Task System Integration

Use the configured task system for durable work items. Check and configure the task system MCP server when asked and when a non-`none` task system is configured.

---
## Activation

External issue tracking is active (`taskSystem: github`). This repository uses **GitHub** as the system of record for all planned work, follow-up tasks, bugs, and feature requests. All durable work items must be created there, not left only in local notes or branch files.

## MCP Server Setup

When the user asks to set up, check, or configure their task system MCP: check whether the MCP server for **GitHub** is already configured for this platform (see below); confirm success if it connects, otherwise walk the user through the setup steps. If the repository changes its saved `taskSystem` value, re-run `ballast install --refresh-config` so this rule matches the configured system.

### MCP Server

**GitHub Issues** (`github`):
- MCP server: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
- Requires a GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope.
- The token should be set as `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the platform config.

### Platform Setup Steps

**Claude Code:**
- MCP servers are configured in `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `mcpServers` key.
- Add the server entry and restart Claude Code.
- Verify with `/mcp` in the Claude Code CLI.

Example `~/.claude/settings.json` entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Using GitHub for Work Items

- Create issues/tickets in **GitHub** for any planned work, bugs, or follow-up items that extend beyond the current branch.
- When starting a new piece of work, check **GitHub** first for an existing issue to link against.
- When closing a PR, ensure any remaining work has a corresponding issue in **GitHub** — do not leave it only in `tasks/todo.md`.
- Reference issue IDs in commit messages and PR descriptions so work is traceable.

## Important Notes

- `tasks/todo.md` is a branch-local task artifact, not a substitute for durable issue tracking (see the `tasks/todo.md` rule).
- If the MCP server is unavailable, fall back to the **GitHub** web UI and link issues manually in PR descriptions.
- Keep credentials out of committed files; use environment variables or platform secret stores.
