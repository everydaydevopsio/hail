# Terraform Testing Rules

## Your Responsibilities

1. Add `terraform fmt -check -recursive` and `terraform validate` as the minimum validation path.
2. Add `tflint` and a security scanner, preferring `trivy config` for new work and keeping `tfsec` only for legacy-compatible pipelines.
3. Ensure `tfenv` is part of the documented setup so validation runs against the intended Terraform version.
4. Add a smoke path that runs `terraform init -backend=false` before validation.
5. Add native `terraform test` coverage for Terraform 1.6+ modules that can assert plan or apply behavior with `.tftest.hcl` files.
6. Use Terratest when the repo already has Go-based infrastructure tests or needs live integration coverage outside native test assertions.
7. Make plan generation a review step for live environments and keep apply workflows separate from validation.
8. Fail CI on formatting, validation, lint, test, or security regressions.

## Baseline Commands

- `tfenv install`
- `tfenv use`
- `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
- `terraform init -backend=false`
- `terraform validate`
- `tflint --init`
- `tflint --recursive`
- `trivy config .`
- `tfsec .` when preserving a legacy pipeline
- `terraform test`

For OpenTofu repositories, use equivalent commands such as `tofu fmt -check -recursive`, `tofu init -backend=false`, `tofu validate`, and `tofu test`.

## Example Coverage

Use a root Terraform project with pinned versions and a lightweight module structure as the minimum test target:

- initialize providers without touching remote state
- validate root modules and representative child modules
- lint recursively with `tflint`
- run a security scan over the full tree
- run native `terraform test` for modules with `.tftest.hcl` or `.tftest.json` tests
- generate a plan in non-production environments before any apply workflow

## CI Placement

PR validation should be read-only and include formatting, backend-free initialization, validation, TFLint, security scanning, and native tests where present.

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: terraform-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

Keep apply workflows merge-gated, environment-protected, and separate from PR validation. Use a saved plan only within the same trusted workflow context, never as a committed artifact.

Atlantis, Terraform Cloud, HCP Terraform, and OpenTofu-compatible orchestration platforms are acceptable when the repository already uses them; keep Ballast guidance aligned with that orchestrator's plan/apply separation and approval model.

## Important Notes

- `terraform validate` depends on initialization, so run `terraform init -backend=false` first.
- Keep plan files out of Git and treat them as transient artifacts.
- Prefer environment-specific `tfvars` files or workspace wiring over hand-edited resource blocks.
- Security scanners are noisy when providers are misconfigured; fix the provider and version baseline before suppressing findings.
- Prefer native `terraform test` for module contract tests in Terraform 1.6+ and use `command = plan` when a test should avoid creating real infrastructure.
- For shared modules, use Terratest or example-module smoke tests when the repo already has Go-based test infrastructure or needs live integration coverage.

## When Completed

1. Show the validation and security commands you added.
2. Tell the user which Terraform roots or modules are covered.
3. Call out anything that still needs a live-environment plan/apply review.
